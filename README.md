# What is this?
A small project where I remake Primel.

## To-do List
- [x] Stats display when no games played
- [x] Add some indication about how cookies are used
- [ ] Figure out how to get the buttons to hover in dark mode
- [ ] Add some more animations

## Credits (as seen on site)
> A recreation of David Lawrence Miller's rendition of [Primel](https://converged.yt/primel/), and heavily inspired by the original [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). Think of this as a practice Primel. 
> High contrast colors taken from [Waffle](https://wafflegame.net/).
> 
> Thanks to Grace for picking the font (Cambria).
